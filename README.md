# ai-youtube-channel
This is an automation solution for creating AI content for your YouTube channel.

# How It Works
To use the automation you need to provide a list (in a text file) with ideas, background music, and videos. The automation triggers LLM to generate the text content. When the text content is done, you can continue generating the audio using the TTS program (using the WEB interface). When the audio is ready, the automation uses FFMPEG to combine the TTS audio with background music and videos. The automation is choosing videos and background music randomly. By that approach, you can generate YouTube videos automatically.  
There is a solution for generating automatically images from Gencraft.
